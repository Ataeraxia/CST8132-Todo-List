# CST8132 Assignment #3 and #4 - ToDo List

This program was built for my Object-Oriented Programming course at Algonquin College. This program works as a simple todo list. It adds tasks and task information from the user. It also can save and load tasks to a text file.

In Assignment #3, the learning outcomes were:

1. To create a program that allowed the user to add and remove tasks, view all tasks, toggle as task as complete and vice-versa, and exit the program.
2. Exception Handling, with an introduction to using the ArrayList<E> container from java.util.
3. Use JUnit for testing

In Assignment #4, the learning outcomes were:

1. Save to, and load records from a text file
2. Use comparators to sort the arrayList by title, priority, and isComplete
